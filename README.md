# Fanuc Stream Motion

*(The author of this software is not affiliated with FANUC Corporation in any way.)*

The Stream Motion function (J519) allows an external device to control a robotâ€™s motion by sending UDP packets through the Ethernet connection between the external device. The robot moves to the commanded position after a very short delay.

This repository includes software to control Fanuc manipulators via the Stream Motion function. 

For more information on the protocol please refer to Fanuc's offical documentation.
